# mutiplayer-game-or-dual-game-made-using-arduino-and-java.
This game was made along with two other team members. I am uploading a pdf which contains code details and other important stuff. Our game is multiplayer with two shooters shooting at each other with bullets controlled by touch sensors . The shooters are controlled by two ultrasonic sensors respectively . The ultrasonic sensors are attached adjacent to each other on the box where two joysticks are use for their movement . For the bullets the touch sensors would be placed in the opposite hand.  With the help of ultrasonic sensors the shooters are moving up and down and with the help of touch sensors the bullets are moving towards the opposite shooter . There is also enemy also in the middle for bonus points hence make it single player.
